## Evaluating News Articles with NLP

# Summary

In this project, I have built a single page application to provide users with a service to run Natural Language Processing over a text they enter. For this functionality, the app makes a request to the external MeaningCloud Sentiment Analysis API and dynamically updates the User Interface with the results.

Webpack is used for packaging, service workers are installed to provide offline functionality and Jest is used as a testing framework.  

# Commands
1. run 'npm install' to install all dependencies

3. run 'npm run build-prod' to create the dist folder
4. run 'npm start' for the prod-environment to open when navigating to localhost:8081
